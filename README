What you'll find here:

nozzle.pcb - layout of the electronicals
nozzle.X - firmware for the electronicals

final.FCStd - latest tubes.  
    Everything else except where motors attach to tubes is outdated.
motor.FCStd - latest motor parts
base.FCStd - base + electronical platform
bearing.FCStd - latest bearing parts

tube.c - generate isogrid tubes
exit.c - generate the exit nozzle
3dstuff.h - common 3D functions



This design used leftover motors without encoders from polulu.  An
easier design would use gearmotors with built in encoders from
adafruit.com.  Lighter motors are better.  100:1 or more is better.

The base doesn't support it when it's sideways.  It needs a metal tube
inside the 1st isogrid to point sideways.

Parts must be exported in STL format from a bunch of places.
Print small parts 1st to test fit.
The latest versions of each part are listed here.
Only use raft with 2mm margin + support touching base when necessary.
25% infill
Tube sections have a convex overhang on 1 end to avoid support.
    That must be printed on top.

standalone motor parts:
     - print with no raft
     - 50% infill
     - Support must be everywhere instead of just touching base
    motor.FCStd
        pinion
        top platform
        strap
         - Print the laminations perpendicular to the motor axis


tubes with motor parts:
    final.FCStd
        inlet
        elbows
        oblique or straight bottom base depending on the tube section
        tube section
         - Tubes must be printed with the tapered overhang on top.
         - Print with a brim & support to aid the 1mm alignment rings
        cable guards
         - Only needed for 2 motors.
         - hot glued on
         - Print the laminations perpendicular to the motor axis
         - use a brim to aid separating the support

bare tubes:
    final.FCStd
        elbow
        exit elbow
        - Print with a brim & support to aid the 1mm alignment rings
        
exit nozzle:
    exit
    - print with support & brim to aid the chevrons

bearing parts:
     - print with no raft or support to get flat sides
    bearing.FCStd
        split mane gear with 2 different gear splitters to get 2 halves
        bearing inner
        bearing outer

base:
    no support
    skirt adhesion
    base.FCStd
        base
        electronicals + screw holes
