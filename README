What you'll find here:

nozzle.pcb - obsolete layout of the electronicals
nozzle.X - obsolete firmware for the electronicals

nozzle.c - atmega328 firmware for common motor controller
nozzle5.pcb - layout of common motor controller

export*.FCMacro: obsolete scripts

final.FCStd - print tube segments with motor attachments

monitor.c - dump debugging statements from serial port without motor polling commands

motor2.FCStd - latest motor assembly

base.FCStd - base + electronical platform

bearing2.FCStd - latest bearing parts.  
    Mane gear must be 2 parts to be installed.
    Print mane gear ORed with print mask.  Print mask must be rotated 180 deg 
    not cut in order to get the horizontal expansion gap.
    Print bearing inner, bearing outer


tube.c - generate isogrid tubes

elbow1.FCStd: model for elbow1 & elbow3 segments
 - the 2 elbow segments with motors use identical tube sections
 - must transfer to final.FCStd & print with motor mounts
 - subtract inside from motor mount but don't print it
 - remove support after printing

elbow2.FCStd: print to get elbow2
    - support is on opposite side as elbow1
    - remove support after printing
    - must glue elbow2 & elbow3 so the short & long sides line up

exit.c - generate the exit nozzle to be combined with exit.FCStd
    Run exit to generate exit.stl

exit.FCSTd:
    - print tube & exit separately from here
    - remove support after printing
    - clip off chevron support


final.FCStd: print segments with motors from here
    - inlet + inlet motor mount
    - elbow1 + elbow1 motor mount
    - elbow3 + elbow3 motor mount
    - other segments are only shown to aid alignment
    - must glue elbow2 & elbow3 so the short & long sides line up

inlet.FCStd: model for inlet segment
    - must transfer to final.FCStd & print with motor mount

3dstuff.h - common 3D functions






--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Programming the common motor controller:

Set the board number in nozzle.h
make clean

Program the bootloader
make nozzle_fuse
make bootloader_isp






--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Previous notes:

This design used leftover motors without encoders from polulu.  An
easier design would use gearmotors with built in encoders from
adafruit.com.  Lighter motors are better.  100:1 or more is better.

The latest versions of each part are listed here.
25% infill


standalone motor parts:
     - print with no raft
     - 50% infill
     - Support must be everywhere instead of just touching base
    motor2.FCStd
        pinion
        top platform
        strap
         - Print the laminations perpendicular to the motor axis


tubes with motor parts:
    final.FCStd
        inlet
        elbows
        oblique or straight bottom base depending on the tube section
        tube section
         - Tubes must be printed with the tapered overhang on top.
         - Print with a brim & support to aid the 1mm alignment rings
        cable guards
         - Only needed for 2 motors.
         - hot glued on
         - Print the laminations perpendicular to the motor axis
         - use a brim to aid separating the support

bearing parts:
     - print with no raft or support to get flat sides
    bearing.FCStd
        split mane gear with 2 different gear splitters to get 2 halves
        bearing inner
        bearing outer

base:
    no support
    skirt adhesion
    base.FCStd
        base
        electronicals + screw holes
